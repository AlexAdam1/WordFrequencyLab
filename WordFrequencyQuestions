Q. Explain how I would perform a frequency analysis of a website if I had to do it. 
A. If I had to perform a frequency analysis of a website, then I would use the program to create an array of all the words listed in the website,
and use this array to find the specified word that is requested. This is very commmon, as in most websites you can use the control + f shortcut to open a
promp that allows you to search through every word and element in a website.

Q. What was my challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?
A. I again did not have many problems, but it did take me a while to figure out the case-specific search it was looking for,
